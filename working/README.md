# Vtl Software Utility Templates

This collection of C# templates has been designed to allow you to quickly create a projects ( currently Console and winforms) that are preconfigured to work with the VtlSoftware.Aspects.Logging library.

When you launch the project you can select the net framework version you wish to use, the version of the C# language you wish to use and the logging framework you wish to use.

You can find a more detail description of the Templates in the online help provided for the logging library which is available [here.](https://vtlsoftware.co.uk/aspectdocs/Introduction.html)
